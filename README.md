# About me

Hi👋, my name is Alejandro Piguave. I am a mobile developer👨‍💻 from Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸. My most used languages are Java, Kotlin and Swift.

## A timeline of my work 💼
I got into programming in 2015 because I was interested in making videogames. Later, I got interested in Android development so I learned Java. Over the next 5 years, I would develop Android applications in my free time. 
### Some of my personal projects
* [Bug 🪲](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electribolt.bug&hl=es&gl=US) (Feb 2015 - May 2015)
* [Maze Escape 🏃‍♂️](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electribolt.mazescape&hl=es&gl=US) (Jul 2015 - Oct 2015)
* [Marcianito Invaders 👾](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electribolt.marcianito&hl=es&gl=US) (Feb 2015 - Mar 2017)
* [Marcianito GO 👽](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexpi.marcianitogo&hl=es&gl=US) (Aug 2016 - Jul 2019)
* [2048i ✅](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexpi.game2048&hl=es&gl=US) (Feb 2017 - Mar 2017)

After that, I worked as an Android engineer at Ciber Experis from February 2020 to April 2021 and at Accenture from April 2021 until September 2021.

Meanwhile, I've been working on some open-source side projects where I focus on improving the quality of my code and learning new technologies. Here are some examples:

* [TinderCloneCompose 🔥](https://github.com/alejandro-piguave/TinderCloneCompose)
* [TinderCloneSwiftUI 🔥](https://github.com/alejandro-piguave/TinderCloneSwiftUI)

I currently study Software Engineering at Polytechnic University of Madrid.
