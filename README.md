# About me

Hi👋, my name is Alejandro Piguave. I am a mobile developer👨‍💻 from Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸. My most used languages are Java, Kotlin and Swift.

## A timeline of my work 💼
I started to learn Java in 2015 because I wanted to make a Minecraft mod. Later, I got interested in Android development. Over the next 5 years, I would develop Android applications in my free time. 
### Some of my personal projects
* [Bug 🪲](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electribolt.bug&hl=es&gl=US) (Feb 2015 - May 2015)
* [Maze Escape 🏃‍♂️](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electribolt.mazescape&hl=es&gl=US) (Jul 2015 - Oct 2015)

After that, I worked as an Android engineer at Ciber Experis from February 2020 to April 2021 and at Accenture from April 2021 until September 2021, when I left to focus on finishing my [degree in Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=gradomatematicasinformatica&idioma=english) at Polytechnic University of Madrid. 

Meanwhile, I've been working on open-source projects focusing on improving the quality of my code and learning new technologies. Here are some examples:
